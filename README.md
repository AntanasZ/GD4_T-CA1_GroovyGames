	1.1 Do not commit to main
	1.2 Do not branch from main ( Unless bug fixing )
	1.3 Consider main a "release ready branch"
2. Create new branch for new feature ( from the branch "develop", or the branch you're adding a feature )
	2.1 Pull request to parent branch when done
3. Single responsibility commits - ( Commit single tasks/fixes )
	3.1 Commit often ( Helps merging )
	3.2 Try to keep adding files and changing files in seperate commits if possible
